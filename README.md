# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Rays-Using-CNN

This project aims to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By leveraging deep learning, we automate pneumonia diagnosis to assist healthcare professionals with a more efficient and accurate detection system.

📖 Introduction

Pneumonia is a respiratory infection that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for timely treatment. This project utilizes a CNN-based deep learning model trained on chest X-ray images to classify whether a person has pneumonia or not.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing is sourced from Kaggle:
🔗 Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset

Total Images: 5,863
Categories: Normal, Pneumonia
Dataset Split:
Training Set
Validation Set

Frameworks/Libraries:
TensorFlow & Keras
NumPy & Pandas
Matplotlib & Seaborn
OpenCV
Flask (for web interface)


🚀 Usage

Upload a chest X-ray image through the web interface.
The model processes the image and predicts if pneumonia is detected.
View the classification result and confidence score.

🏗 Model Architecture

The CNN model follows this structure:
Convolutional Layers (for feature extraction)
Pooling Layers (for dimensionality reduction)
Fully Connected Layers (for classification)
Activation Functions: ReLU & Softmax
