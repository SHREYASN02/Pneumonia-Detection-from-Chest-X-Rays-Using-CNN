# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Rays-Using-CNN
This project aims to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By leveraging deep learning, we automate pneumonia diagnosis to assist healthcare professionals with a more efficient and accurate detection system.

ðŸ“– Introduction
Pneumonia is a respiratory infection that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for timely treatment. This project utilizes a CNN-based deep learning model trained on chest X-ray images to classify whether a person has pneumonia or not.
